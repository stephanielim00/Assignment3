Ordering Perfect Description: Our application is an interface for both the restaurant worker and the customer that can be accessed by the customer either directly through the restaurant, a downloadable mobile application, or a central website. It has two purposes, the first to help customers choose exactly how they want their order prepared and the second to help restaurants execute the order exactly as customers have specified. Our application will help create a higher standard for restaurant workers by showing each level of production to its end users (the customer, the cooks, the take-out workers, and management) what exactly needs to be done for an order through a well-designed and easy to understand interface. The application requires end users to physically check off each step in order to move on to the next in the ordering and preparation process. Overall, this creates a higher level of satisfaction for the consumer and and an easier work environment for restaurant workers.
